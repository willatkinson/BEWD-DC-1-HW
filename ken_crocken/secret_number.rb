#
# Secret Number is a game you will build in two parts.
# The purpose of the game is to have players guess a secret number from 1-10.
#
# Read the instructions below.
# This exercise will test your knowledge of Variables and Conditionals.
#

#
# We're ready to program! To practice our Ruby skills lets create a secret number game. 
# In this game players have three tries to guess a secret number between 1 and 10. 
#
# Here are some guidelines to building your game:
#
#	Intros
# 	-	Welcome the player to your game. Let them know who created the game. 
#	  -	Ask for the player's name then personally greet them by printing to the screen, "Hi player_name!"
#	  -	Any good game will communicate the rules. Let the player know they must guess a number between 1 and 10 
#		and that they only have 3 tries to do so.
#
#	Functionality: 
#	 -	Hard code the secret number. Make it a random number between 1 and 10.
#	 - 	Ask the user for their guess.
#	 -	Verify if they were correct. If the player guesses correctly they win the game they should be congratulated and the game should end.
#	 -	If they guess incorrectly, give the player some direction. If they guess too high let them know, if they guess too low, let them know.
#	 - 	Don't forget to let your players know how many guesses they have left. Your game should say something like
#		  "You have X many guesses before the game is over enter a another number"
#	 -	If they don't guess correctly after 3 tries, print that the Player lost and the game is over. Also let them know what the `secret_number` was.
#
# Make sure to add helpful comments to your code to document what each section does.
# 
# Remember to cast input from the Player into the appropriate data type.
#

    if player_guess == secret_number  # Player correctly guesses the secret number and wins!
        puts "You win!  You guessed #{player_guess} and the Secret Number was #{secret_number}.  Well done!"
    elsif player_guess < secret_number && guesses > 1 # Player's guess is less than secret number, with hint
        puts "Guess higher!"
    elsif player_guess > secret_number && guesses > 1 # Player's guess is greater than secret numeber, with hint

    else # Player has run out of guessess and the game ends.
        puts "Sorry, you are out of guesses.  You lose.  The Secret Number was #{secret_number}."

# --- Set the variables, hard code the secret number and set the number of guesses
# --- secret_number = 1 + rand(10) # --- generate a random number
 # Secret number is hard coded.

# --- Start the game, initiate the loop.  Once the player uses up 3 guesses
# --- they lose and the game ends. 
3.downto(1) do |guesses|
    
puts
# --- Display how many guesses are left and request the player to enter their guess.
puts "Guesses left: #{guesses}"

# --- Store the player's guess, convert player's number to an integer
# --- and compare the player's guess to the secret number.
player_guess = gets.to_i

# --- Thank the player for playing.

# Hey Ken, great job on this.  Your method, conditions, and loops are great.
# One thing that wasn't accounted for is if the user gets the correct guess on the
# first try.  The downto loops keeps counting down. 

# One way to account for this is to get rid of your puts methods in sec_number and just return the string.
# That way in your loop your could either puts sec_number(player_guess,guesses) or check for a return value
# to break out of the loop. 

# Keep up the great work!
